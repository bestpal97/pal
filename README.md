# Snake game that's not optimal
I created a snake game then tried to use Astar to solve it. The AI works pretty great except that it does'nt. It works fine for a few moves ~25 then crashes as it cannot find a path using Astar(eg. when snake enters a closed loop or similar orientations)
Next implemetation woud require something more complex like Neural Networks or NEAT(NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies)
